## BDD
Triangle Tracker takes the lengths of three sides and determines if they form a valid triangle.
If so, the tracker returns the name of the kind of triangle the sides make (Equilateral, Isosceles, Scalene).
* The user enter length of side1, side2 and side3
* If the sum of two sides is equal or exceeds the value of the third side, then the program will detect that the values do not form a definite triangle
* If the values entered are all equal to one another, then the program would show that an Equilateral triangle. 
* If two values in the input are equal, third different, the program would show an iscoceles triangle
* If the values entered differ but don't exceed each other by much, triangle would be a Scalene triangle.
